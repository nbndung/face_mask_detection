### Datasets
- The project was trained on 4000 masked images and 4000 not-masked images
- Dataset is too large to upload, below are sources where dataset was compiled:

### About the project
- Preprocess images
- Encoding labels
- Split dataset into train, validation, test datasets
- Build a deep learning model
- Training different models
- Use different face detection models to extract faces
- Rotate image for better detection
- Classify if a face is wearing mask
- Modify, tuning to get better ROC-AUC
